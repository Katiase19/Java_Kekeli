// Since learning Java, I have lerant that a class is a template for creating objects, defining their attributes (data) and methods (behaviors). 
//An object is an instance of a class with unique values. These concepts are crucial in object-oriented programming as they enable code to be reused, modularity, and encapsulated, making software development more efficient.  
//Classes include constructors, which initialize objects, attributes, which store data, and methods, which define behaviors.  
//For example, a "SpellBook" class can have attributes like `spellName` and `manaCost`, a constructor to set these values, and a `castSpell()` method to print a spell action. This structure allows for organized and scalable coding in Java.
